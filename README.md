## So Why Not a Child Theme?

Because we simply needed the bare-bones structure of HTML5 Blank and would be generating almost all the individual templates, there wouldn't be much of the parent theme left. I chose full streamlined control over the future update benefits of a child theme.

## Nota Bene: This Was Built for Chrome

Since this site is only intended for a very specific use case where we could control browser choice, there are no contingencies for browsers that don't support CSS Grid.
